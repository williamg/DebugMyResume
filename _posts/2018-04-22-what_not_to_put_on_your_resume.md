When writing a resume, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the more
you include, the better. If that means using 10pt font and no whitespace, who
cares, as long as I can include all six of the clubs I'm involved with. In my
[last post](http://debugmyresume.com/2018/04/11/quality_over_quantity.html) I
explained how that line of thinking isn't always the best way to go. Today, I'm
going to give a few more items that you may reconsider including unless you want
to put yourself at a disadvantage right off the bat.

### Your GPA If It Isn't Great
When looking at the education section of your resume, I obviously look for a
GPA. If it's not there, I don't think much of it. I certainly don't assume it's
bad--it doesn't factor in to my evaluation of your resume whatsoever. On the
other hand, if you include your GPA and it isn't **great**, then it certainly
doesn't help you.

Now, there are *plenty* of totally valid reasons for having a low GPA, including
ones that might actually indicate you are a talented engineer (I had friends in
college that would rather build robots in their free time than write essays;
they were *super smart* people I'd love to work with). Unfortunately, when a
recruiter is looking at your resume, you don't have the opportunity to tell them 
any of these reasons. They see the GPA, and it's either a mark in your favor or
not.

Now, as to what is a "good" GPA, that's a bit of a tough question. Generally,
I'm looking for a 3.5 or higher, unless you're at a top-tier university, in
which case I drop the bar to around 3.0.

### That Those Projects Were Actually Homework
Many high-level computer science classes feature some capstone "project."
Common ones include an operating system or compiler, but there are also plenty
of unique or student-defined projects being featured lately as part of the curriculum.
These projects can make excellent additions to your resume, especially if you
are lacking on relevant internships. However, I would avoid any indication that
these projects were assigned as part of classwork. A project done "just because"
is more impressive than a project done because you had to. For example, consider
the example project description below:

> Worked with 3 other students to develop a web app for the class "Introduction
> to Web Development". My partners and I met regularly to work on homework
> assignments and build features of the app. Our application allowed students
> to find and reserve rooms around campus. Our project received an A.

Clearly, this was done as part of a class. We could rewrite this as follows to
potentially throw a suspicious recruiter off the trail:

> Worked with a team to develop a web app that allowed students to find and
> reserve rooms around campus. I worked on the user interface in ReactJS, which
> provided a campus map and a list of times that each room was available. My
> teammates and I met regularly to ensure we  were on track to meet deadlines
> and deployed the application in just 5 months.

Notice how there's no mention that this was done as part of a class project and
how I emphasized my personal contributions to the project.

Of course, the fact that the project was done as part of a class might come out
as part of the interview process (and you certainly shouldn't lie and say that
it isn't!). But once you've gotten an interview, your skills will speak for
themselves. Of course, if a project actually *was* something you did in your
spare time, try to highlight that in the description.

### Non-Technical Experience
This last tip may be slightly controversial. I've heard many people suggest
putting non-technical experience on your resume as evidence of "soft"
skills or just to show that you're an actual human being and not a robot. I,
personally, disagree for two reasons:

1. Space is valuable. You only have 8.5x11" of paper to impress a recruiter.
Anything that takes up space but doesn't demonstrate your value as a potential
employee is *wasted space*.
2. Many "soft" skills can be just as easily developed and showcased as part of
technical experiences. Talk about how you presented your work, or how you were
perhaps a mentor to your peers.

If I had a choice between seeing detailed technical descriptions or
seeing all the sports you play, I'd definitely prefer reading about your
technical abilities.

## Closing Thoughts
The moral of the story here is that putting the wrong things on your resume
can be just as harmful as not including the right things. In my next post, I'll
start delving in to what exactly the *right* things are, and how you can
optimize your descriptions to craft an exceptional resume.
