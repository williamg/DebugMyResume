When looking at a resume, one of the first things I look for is the place where
the candidate enumerates their programming language proficiencies and other
skills. I'm looking for two things:

1. What kind of candidate is this? Are they a front-end or back-end dev? Do they
   have experience with our technology stack?
2. Is this candidate **really good** at anything?

Given that I'm trying to answer these two questions, this is about the
worst-case scenario (and you wouldn't believe how common it is):

> **Skills**: C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Matlab, Bash 
>
> **Other Skills**: Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, MySQL, Microsoft Access

Great. Now I have absolutely no way to answer question 1 and I'm going to go
ahead and assume the answer to question 2 is "no".

The skills section is not meant to be an inventory of every piece of technology
you've ever touched. Everything in that section should be both:

- Relevant to the job for which you're applying
- Something about which/in which you'd be comfortable answering an interview question

Anything else is just noise that distracts the person reviewing your resume. So,
get rid of all the languages of which you don't have a working knowledge. For
most people, I expect this will do the job and get the list down to 1-3
languages. If you truly are a programming language polyglot, then there are a
few strategies that I can suggest:

### Group Similar Technologies Together
For example, we could rework some of the languages in the example above as follows:

> **Skills**: C/C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript/Node.js, Python

This is much more believable to me, despite still being pretty extensive. Here,
the skills are grouped into 4 distinct skills, despite being 6/7 distinct technologies
(depending on whether or not you actually distinguish Javascript and Node).
Further, as a developer, I don't really question any of the groupings because I
know that they are actually related.

### Divide by Expertise
Alternatively, you can list a wide swath of languages if you make it clear which
ones are your strongest. Something like this is common:

> **Skills**: (Experienced) C/C++, (Familiar)  Ruby, HTML/CSS/Javascript

Now I can easily see that "Oh this is a C++ dev who's done some WebDev". That
said, don't use this as an excuse to just dump everything in your "Familiar"
section. As I said earlier, you should still focus on relevant technologies
that you actually have experience with.

### Tailor Based on Company
Probably the best method, though, is to tailor your skills based on the company
and position for which you are applying. Most companies list the tech stack
they use on the positions page. Be sure that you actually know those languages
and then be sure they are highlighted in your skills section. Obviously, this
requires more work on your end, but it will almost definitely pay off. When I
see a candidate that lists our entire tech stack on their resume (which is
listed in plain sight on the job description) they're almost a shoo-in for an
interview. (Seriously, read the job description, it's like cheat codes for
getting an interview.)

## Closing Thoughts
The idea of "quality over quantity" extends far beyond the "Skills" section
of your resume. It applies equally to your projects and your past work
experience. It's generally more useful to market yourself as a highly-skilled
individual in the domains that are relevant to the company than as a
jack-of-all-trades.
